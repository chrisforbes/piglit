 *
 * Verify behavior when a program object with no shaders attached is used.
 * Neither the OpenGL spec nor the GLSL spec are explicit about what happens
 * in this case.  However, the correct behavior can be infered from a few bits
 * in the spec.  Section 2.15 of the GL 2.1 spec says:
 *
 *     "When the program object currently in use includes a vertex shader, its
 *     vertex shader is considered active and is used to process vertices. If
 *     the program object has no vertex shader, or no program object is
 *     currently in use, the fixed-function method for processing vertices is
 *     used instead."
 *
 * Section 3.11 of the OpenGL 2.1 spec says:
 *
 *     "When the program object currently in use includes a fragment shader,
 *     its fragment shader is considered active, and is used to process
 *     fragments. If the program object has no fragment shader, or no program
 *     object is currently in use, the fixed-function fragment processing
 *     operations described in previous sections are used."
 *
 * If there is no vertex shader in the program, fixed-function vertex state is
 * used.  If there is no fragment shader in the program, fixed-function
 * fragment state is used.  If there is no vertex shader and no fragment
 * shader in the program, fixed-function vertex and fragment state are used.
 *
 * This test configures some simple fixed-function vertex and fragment state.
 * It verifies that this state is used when an "empty" program is active.
